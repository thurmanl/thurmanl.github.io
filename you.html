        If you were to tell me
        a year ago
        that I would find a girl
        tall, health nut
        incredibly cute, artistic
        excellent chef like my mom
        smart, ambitious, pre-med
        unrelentingly kind
        sincerely spiritual
        well traveled and bilingual
        and childishly excitable,
        I’m not sure I would’ve had the faith
        to dare to believe it.

    I see my life as a canvas,
each stroke of color representing
a person
a place
an experience
a goal
a passion
a season.
The painting changes over time
as new colors cover up old ones.
Not sadly, mind you - it’s a happy painting
the old colors were duly appreciated
before they ceded to the new.
I am content to accept that
the constant of life is change.
Yet still I search to find the one color
to define the painting.
The person to call mine
To be in all places with me
To experience all things with me
The goal of my life
The passion of my existence
The unchanging in all seasons
I look at my painting and wonder
if the prominent color might remain forever
Your Color.

My emotions are trapped inside a steel box.
Cold, hard steel. Emotionless.
I’m the meticulous engineer, selecting which emotions to wire out, allow themselves to manifest.
Contentment, even happiness. Occasional joy or passion.
I quickly patch up any leaks that occur.
Why do I do it? Emotions are dangerous. Emotions are unpredictable.
You come.
Your presence is a blowtorch, your smile is a crowbar
You work open my box and discover the leaks, but you don’t patch them up.
Instead, you celebrate them, nurturing each one good and bad.
Each is accepted and forms part of a growing garden that defines me. You cultivate it.
Some emotions insist on hiding -
Like a shy animal from a hunter they protect themselves.
or maybe a baby deer that hasn’t figured out how to walk yet
wobbly knees my emotions are.
feeble like the first 3 matches attempting to light a fire
when will they ignite? I don’t know.
Patience - the gardener's greatest tool.
