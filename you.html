  <h1>Sketchbook</h1>
  <h3>A collection of poems I wrote in an attempt to describe my thoughts and feelings.
    To never let Laura forget how special she is. To communicate the state of my emotions.
    I call them sketches because I just write them once, so they're pretty rough and without revision.

        If you were to tell me
        a year ago
        that I would find a girl
        tall, health nut
        incredibly cute, artistic
        excellent chef like my mom
        smart, ambitious, pre-med
        unrelentingly kind
        sincerely spiritual
        well traveled and bilingual
        and childishly excitable,
        I’m not sure I would’ve had the faith
        to dare to believe it.

    var lines2 = `
    I see my life as a canvas,
each stroke of color representing
a person
a place
an experience
a goal
a passion
a season.
The painting changes over time
as new colors cover up old ones.
Not sadly, mind you - it’s a happy painting
the old colors were duly appreciated
before they ceded to the new.
I am content to accept that
the constant of life is change.
Yet still I search to find the one color
to define the painting.
The person to call mine
To be in all places with me
To experience all things with me
The goal of my life
The passion of my existence
The unchanging in all seasons
I look at my painting and wonder
if the prominent color might remain forever
Your Color.

My emotions are trapped inside a steel box.
Cold, hard steel. Emotionless.
I’m the meticulous engineer, selecting which emotions to wire out, allow themselves to manifest.
Contentment, even happiness. Occasional joy or passion.
I quickly patch up any leaks that occur.
Why do I do it? Emotions are dangerous. Emotions are unpredictable.
You come.
Your presence is a blowtorch, your smile is a crowbar
You work open my box and discover the leaks, but you don’t patch them up.
Instead, you celebrate them, nurturing each one good and bad.
Each is accepted and forms part of a growing garden that defines me. You cultivate it.
Some emotions insist on hiding -
Like a shy animal from a hunter they protect themselves.
or maybe a baby deer that hasn’t figured out how to walk yet
wobbly knees my emotions are.
feeble like the first 3 matches attempting to light a fire
when will they ignite? I don’t know.
Patience - the gardener's greatest tool.

var lines4 = `
My hands idly ripped your note
The one you slipped into my pocket
The day before you left
The one on which you wrote
Words fit for a matching locket
words of which my heart is yet bereft:
I love you.

Do my hands rip more than just this paper?
Do my words tear up your heart?
Do I unknowingly wreak havoc on your mentality?
Does my hesitation cause your confidence to taper?
Do you feel yourself slowly fall apart?
All for lack of the words to fill my heart’s cavity:
I love you.

I regret ripping your note
accident though it were
just like I regret ever hurting you.
But the honesty to which I devote
demands loyalty to what my feelings are
and aren’t, a dedication I hold onto.
`

var lines5 = `
I long to say I love you
Yet I know I can’t
lest I betray the truthfulness
and my honesty recant.

It’s not that I don’t care for you
for care I certainly do.
It’s not that I don’t feel for you
as these poems I think do show.

But “love” is something quite special;
a true devotion given.
and you know I mean to keep it safe
to give my heart full permission.

I hope to soon earn understanding
and gain it through reflection
to give you what you deserve
those key words of affection
that I long to say
`

var lines6 = `
To see past a person’s shell
to what they are inside
to really know their true intentions
what their looks may hide

Is really important in relationships
to know your partner’s heart
but I only have one problem:
you’re so dang cute it’s hard!

I try to search your eyes for answers
but get caught studying your face
wondering how I deserve such beauty
and against my carnal feelings brace

And so my constant quest continues
to sense beyond to your true being
and not distract my wand’ring eyes
by the beauty of you seeing.
`

var lines7 = `
Stay on the strait and narrow
I walk on a narrow bridge
wide enough for one, straight as an arrow.
Far above a rushing river
that leads souls straight to hell
not to be touched by me, a believer.

The bridge is golden, out of reach
of those who row beneath
a path defined by what the scriptures teach.
I tread carefully and slowly
for one mistake would betray my integrity
and prove I’m not so meek and lowly.

Many boats travel below
filled by many, a couple, or one alone
some rowing, most carried by the flow.
Some strange vessels fight the current
intertwining with the bridge’s pillars
like piranhas, a pretended adherent

Surprised to find they move so quick
I study their mode of locomotion
and see a large sail on a stick
It pushes hard so full of air
to fight the waves and water
The sail is Christ, God’s own heir.

How is that Christ? There’s no wind here
across the lifted walkway. Is it possible
that to his own way He’d not adhere?
Confused, I examine my own way
scriptures, statues, laws and commandments
yet without friends or any leeway.

It comes to me, a sudden thought
Christ is not meant to be traveled on
but by and through, in His winds caught.
the journey is turbulent but just the means
to reach the divine destination
the path guiding through life’s streams.

I jump.
A leap of faith.
